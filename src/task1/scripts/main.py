    ## To Do's:

    ## SEGMENTER TRAINING:

    # Augmentation and merge to X_char_train and y_char_train...

    # Generate training scrolls and validation scrolls from new X_char_train, y_char_train

    # Train a segmenter with the training scrolls

    # Tune the segmenter based on the validation scrolls

    ## PREDICTOR TRAINING:

    # Train a predictor model with X_char_train and y_char_train

    # Tune the predictor using X_char_val and y_char_val

    # Output: Make sure to map each 'English' label with its 'Hebrew' equivalent

    ## FINAL PIPELINE

    # Pass the test scrolls as inputs to the Segmenter and pass the Segmenter's outputs as inputs to the Predictor.


    ## Load test scrolls
